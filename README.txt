This repository is for code from the AppleTV series Tehran.
The code is not intended to be used for any criminal, political, or illegal acts. 
I titled the files what they were titled in the show if I could. 
Based on the imports there are missing modules that the creators were calling that we did not see as viewers.

It is clear that the show hired someone with knowledge and allowed them to actually craft code snippets 
that fit what the characters were doing in the scene.
